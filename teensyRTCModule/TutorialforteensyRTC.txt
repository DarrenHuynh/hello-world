Teensy pinout: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/pinout.html



need to install libraries:
FlexCan Library for teensy: https://github.com/teachop/FlexCAN_Library
Teensy Low Power Library (snooze library): https://github.com/duff2013/Snooze



Current working version File: 
TeensyLowPowerRTC: need to implement CANBUS transmit

Discription of each folder:
ArudinoRecieveTest: code uploaded to an arduino to test incoming serial messages
Teensy_hibernate_digitalpin_wakeup: test hibernate/wakeup on the teensy
TeensyTransmitTest: Test serial transmit
TimeTeensy3: Test internal RTC of teensy
TeensyLowPowerRTC: Combination of above code to have a working low power RTC. Hibernate/wakeup, Time keeping, serial transmit

To set the correct UTC time change time_t = current_unix_epoch_time in the setup() section of the arduino code;  
current_unix_epoch_time can be found from https://www.epochconverter.com/ then upload code to teensy.
